	<h2>Research Experience</h2><br>
	
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-2"><b>Jun 2016 - Present</b></div>
		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>Research Associate at University of York, UK</b><br>
			Worked on an industriall funded project, developing large-scale Matlab simulation models to investigate radio resource 
			and topology management in novel LTE network architectures for 5G.
			Currently working on the EPSRC USMART project, focusing on medium access control and channel modelling for underwater acoustic sensor networks.

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-2"><b>Oct 2015 - Jun 2016</b></div>
		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>Researcher at BT, Martlesham, UK</b><br>
			Developed system-level (Matlab/Octave) and packet-level (ns-3, C++) simulation models 
			of Wi-Fi networks. In particular, focused on investigating the effects of interference 
			and contention between neighbouring home networks.

		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>EU Funded PhD Research at University of York, UK</b><br>
			Developed novel reinforcement learning methods applied to future mobile cellular systems. 
			The main contribution of this PhD project was the increased speed and robustness of 
			reinforcement learning based dynamic spectrum access algorithms. 
			Notable outputs of this research are articles published in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing
			and in IEEE Access, a best paper award at ISWCS 2013, two invited papers at MCC 2013 and WPMC 2014, 
			and invited talks at the Oxford Brookes University and at an EuCNC 2015 workshop. 
			This work was funded by the European FP7 ABSOLUTE project.

		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>MEng Project at University of York, UK</b><br>
			Investigated reinforcement learning techniques and their application to control of the rotary inverted pendulum. 
			The project involved research and simulations of several reinforcement learning algorithms, 
			as well as the design and implementation of one of them for real-time swing-up and balance control 
			of the inverted pendulum. It received the awards as the best avionics MEng project of the year, 
			and as the best MEng project overall.

		<div class="col-sm-2"><b>Jul 2011 - Sep 2011</b></div>
		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>EPSRC Funded Research Placement at University of York, UK</b><br>
			Received an EPSRC scholarship to undertake a 10-week research placement in control engineering. 
			Worked individually on a research project. Developed a full state feedback controller for stabilizing 
			the rotary inverted pendulum, using a PIC microcontroller as the processing unit. 
			Also developed an energy based controller for the swing-up of the inverted pendulum. 
			These controllers have been used for hardware demonstrations on all UCAS days since then, 
			as well as during the 2nd year control module lectures.

		<div class="col-sm-10">
			<b>Teaching Assistant at University of York, UK</b><br>
			Gave a series of revision lectures on control engineering. Worked as a teaching assistant or 
			laboratory demonstrator in the following undergraduate and MSc courses: Control Engineering, 
			Automatic Flight Control Systems, Control Systems Engineering for Robotics, 
			Systems Programming for Embedded Devices, Java Programming, C Programming. 
			Demonstrating in some of these modules involved being the lab leader and marking assignments. 
			Also undertaking the PFA programme, described in the Education section, in parallel with teaching.
