University of York<br>
Oct 2012 - present</td>
            <td class="RightCVColumn">
Investigating applications of artificial intelligence to radio resource management in future cellular systems. The main contribution of this PhD project is the increased speed and reliability of machine learning based dynamic spectrum access algorithms. Notable outputs of this research to date are two IEEE Transactions journal submissions, a best paper award at ISWCS 2013, two invited papers at MCC 2013 and WPMC 2014, and an invited talk at the Oxford Brookes University. This work is funded by the European FP7 ABSOLUTE project.

Investigated reinforcement learning techniques and their application to control of the rotary inverted pendulum. The project involved research and simulations of several reinforcement learning algorithms, as well as the design and implementation of one of them for real-time swing-up and balance control of the inverted pendulum. It received the awards as the best avionics MEng project of the year, and as the best MEng project overall.

Received an EPSRC scholarship to undertake a 10-week research placement in control engineering. Worked individually on a research project. Developed a full state feedback controller for stabilizing the rotary inverted pendulum, using a PIC microcontroller as the processing unit. Also developed an energy based controller for the swing-up of the inverted pendulum. These controllers have been used for hardware demonstrations on all UCAS days since then, as well as during the 2nd year control module lectures.
